	<h2> About Me</h2> 
	<p>I am a first year sophmore in college here at the University of South Carolina in 
	Columbia. I am majoring in Biological Sciences and plan to dental after receiving my bachelors
	degree in three and a half years. I enjoy arts and craft and hanging out with friends. Something 
	intresting about me is that I enjoy learning new things. I especially loved learning to put things 
	together and help my mom around the house.</p> 
	<p><span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
	Now that I am older I still enjoy helping my mother out, it bring me joy. My favorite color is 
	pink. Pink describes my personality the best and I am absolutely obsessed. I have a pink dorm, the 
	inside of my car is pink,my macbook is designed pink, and more. It is not that I am a girly girl but I
	the color is beautiful in every shade and always gives on a positive vibe. </span></p>

	<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2> 
	<p>After graduating USC and dental school (undetermined school) I plan to work several years and 
	build up my experince as a dentist. I then plan to work hands on with cosmetic dentistry such as veneers,
	dentures, and implants. This will set me up perfectly to open my own cosmetic dentist office in a large city
	where my business can thrive.</p> 
	<p>I enjoy working with peoples smiles and making them feel good about themselves. Someones confidence
	can be completely torn down because they do not have a nature straight smile. Being that person to help 
	someones life change is such a rewarding experience. I cannot wait to become this person!</p>
